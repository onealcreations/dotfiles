Commit Message Guidelines

FEAT		commits that add or remove a feature
FIX		commits that fix a bug
REFACTOR	commits for rewrites / restructuring to the code, but no change in behavior
STYLE		commits for changes to syntax (removing white spaces, correcting formatting, etc)
DOCS		commits that affect documentation only
CHORE		commits for consistent things such as updating as part of a daily task

After deciding hit 'q' to exit and enter your commit message to finalize.
